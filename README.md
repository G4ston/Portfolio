# Nuclear-Plants
This is an app that I created with folium library in python. 
I created a map which contains pop ups locating all the nuclear power plants in the world. 
The pop ups has three diferents types of colours depending of the energy capacity / darkblue = High capacity, blue = Medium capacity / lightblue = low capacity. 
Each pop up contains a link embeb which redirects to google search with the especific information of the plant. 
The folium library creates a html script.
